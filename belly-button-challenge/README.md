This challenge is comprised of building an interactive web dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Bioveristy](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) dataset using Javascript. The libraries used in developing the data-driven web elements include D3.js and Plotly. The scripts are documented in detail in [app.js](static/js/app.js) and [bonus.js](static/js/bonus.js). The completed dashboard has been deloyed to a [Github webpage](https://skullfort.github.io/belly-button-challenge/).
