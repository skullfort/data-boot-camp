# leaflet-challenge

04/07/2023

This challenge consists of two parts. The first part fetches GeoJSON data that represent earthquakes with magnitude greater than 2.5 for the past 7 days from the USGS API. The earthquakes are marked by circles at their coordinates on an open source street map. The circles reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. The second part of the challenge adds more options for base maps and introduces the tectonic plates dataset. The tectonic plates and earthquakes datasets become separate overlays that can be turned on and off independently. Each part of the challenge can be visualized from the index.html in their respective folder. The Javascript libraries used to complete this challenge include D3.js and Leaflet.js.
