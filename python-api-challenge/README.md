The API keys used were for OpenWeather and Geoapify. Random coordinates were generated in WeatherPy.ipynb and the corresponding nearest cities were found using the citipy library. Plots in both WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb are based on these citiesl; as such, if a different set of random coordinates is generated, many plot configurations will need to be adjusted.
