# sqlalchemy-challenge

03/06/2023

This challenge is comprised of two parts: (1) the analysis and exploration of the Hawaii climate data from 2010-01-01 to 2017-08-23 using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib and (2) a FLASK app based on the queries. The former is documented in `climate_starter.ipynb` and the latter in `app.py`.
