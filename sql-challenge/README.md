# sql-challenge

02/25/2023

The solution to this challenge is composed of the following deliverables:
1. An [ERD](EmployeeSQL/erd.png) of the tables (generated using QuickDBD)
2. Table [schemata](EmployeeSQL/schemata.sql) detailing the data and their relations
3. A jupyter [notebook](EmployeeSQL/data_engineering.ipynb) that verifies the uniqueness of primary keys for each table as well as define value lengths for columns containing strings
4. Queries detailed in [data analysis](EmployeeSQL/data_analysis.sql)

The data, stored in the `data` folder, should be imported in the same order as the corresponding tables in the [schemata](EmployeeSQL/schemata.sql) to avoid errors in PostgreSQL.
