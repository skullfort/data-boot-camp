A new Excel workbook titled "Module 1 Challenge CrowdfundingBook Resubmission" has been uploaded, which incorporates the feedback received on the inital submission. Specfically, the following concerns have been addressed:
- The category and subcategory columns were originally created using the Convert Text to Columns Wizard, and they have now been created using LEFT and RIGHT functions.
- The Live column has been unselected since it is not a part of the assignment for Outcomes Based on Lanuch Dates.
- Variance calculations now use the formula VAR.P().
